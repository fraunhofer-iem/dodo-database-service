# Development Focus

## Description

We want to know how much the developers need to spread themselves between different projects.  
Therefore, we measure the contributions of every project member across all projects to assess how much context switches are happening. This describes the developer spread.
Additionally, we track the kind of tickets every developer works on to see how much work is spent doing bug fixes vs feature development.
This is then averaged across all developers for each project to get an estimate how the effective work distribution is for every project.
