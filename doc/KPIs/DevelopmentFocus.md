# Development Focus

## Description

Development Focus describes the combination of the Developer Spread and the type of tasks the developers work on.\
E.g. the Developer Focus tells us that a Developer spends 60% time on this project. Of these 60% they spend 30% on bug fixes, 30% on code reviews, and 30% on new features.

## Calculation

## Data

- [Issues](Issue.md) the tags and the assignee
- [Developer](Developer.md) the name/id to cross reference with tickets
- [Projects](Project.md)
- [Organization](Organization.md)
- [Developer Spread](DeveloperSpread.md)

## Need for additional Input / Interpretation
* For further interpretation this data can be compared with the planned time distribution. This information can then be used to identify unplanned work.
