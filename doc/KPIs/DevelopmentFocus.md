# Development Focus

## Description

Development Focus describes the combination of the Developer Spread and the type of tasks the developers work on.\
E.g. the Developer Focus tells us that a Developer spends 60% time on this project. Of these 60% they spend 30% on bug fixes, 30% on code reviews, and 30% on new features.
