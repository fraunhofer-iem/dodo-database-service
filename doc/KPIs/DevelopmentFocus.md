# Development Focus

## Description

We want to know on which tasks the developer spent their time inside the project and in general.
Therefore, we measure the contributions of every project member across all projects to assess how much context switches are happening.
Additionally, we track the kind of tickets every developer works on to see how much work is spent doing bug fixes vs feature development.

## Calculation

## Data

- [Issues](Issue.md) the tags and the assignee
- [Developer](Developer.md) the name/id to cross reference with tickets
- [Projects](Project.md)
- [Organization](Organization.md)
