# Pull Requests

## Description
We are interested in pull requests as a form of measuring changes to repositories. We assume that one pull request to dev is comparable with one completed task or maybe one completed feature. Regardless of what the pull request actually contains we at least can assume that the changes inside the pull request contain a complete, functional change, which hopefully also has a semantic connection.
