# Test Coverage

## Description
- Definition taken from ISO25000:
    > What percentage of the system or software capabilities, operational scenarios or functions that are included in their associated test suites are actually performed?
    
- I can't really imagine how to approximate this with pull requests and issues. Do we have this kind of data?
