# Developer Spread

## Description

The developer spread is used to estimate how focused the developers are on a single project. If developers contribute to many different projects on the same day/week /sprint they must switch contexts regularly, which is not good. Many context switches might indicate unplanned work or improper resource planning.
To calculate the developer spread, we analyze the contributions of the developers over a fixed period and count the number of projects they contribute to (with commits, issues, code reviews, ...).

## Calculation

## Data

- [Developer](Developer.md) the name/id to cross reference with tickets
- [Projects](Project.md)
- [Organization](Organization.md)
- [Issues](Issue.md) the tags and the assignee

## Need for additional Input / Interpretation
* For further interpretation this data can be compared with the planned time distribution. This information can then be used to identify unplanned work.
