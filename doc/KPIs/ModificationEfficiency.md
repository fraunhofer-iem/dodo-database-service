# Modification Efficiency

## Description

- We could aggregate the [mean fault correction](MeanFaultCorrectionEfficiency.md) and [mean feature completion](MeanFeatureCompletionEfficiency.md) efficiencies to obtain a general modification efficiency.
- However, I am unsure of how. I don't really want to average two averages, that tends to be inaccurate.
- We could of course repeat the calculation using the base [fault correction](FaultCorrectionEfficiency.md) and [feature completion](FeatureCompletionEfficiency.md) efficiencies. But that would be a bit counter-intuitive in my opinion.
